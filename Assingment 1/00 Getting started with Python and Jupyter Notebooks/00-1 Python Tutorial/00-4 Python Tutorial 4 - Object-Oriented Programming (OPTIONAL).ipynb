    "* #### Class\n",
    "A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Class variable\n",
    "A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Data member\n",
    "A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Function overloading\n",
    "The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Instance variable\n",
    "A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Inheritance\n",
    "The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Instance\n",
    "An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Instantiation\n",
    "The creation of an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Method\n",
    "A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Object\n",
    "A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Operator overloading\n",
    "The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator.\n"
